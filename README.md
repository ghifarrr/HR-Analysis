# HR-Analysis
This analysis allows HR professionals to track and analyze metrics related to the performance of various initiatives and departments, helping with organization, reporting, decision-making, and gathering valuable insights. Also allows HR professionals to view, track and analyze various key performance indicators in both the short and long term. 
I use different visualization tools from tableau or power bi, the tools used are Looker Studio. Where looker studio can be used web-based.

The dashboard created based on the existing HR data is made into 2 parts namely HR performance management dashboard and HR employee attrition dashboard.
Employee performance dashboards help HR teams and business managers understand the effectiveness, satisfaction and progress of their workforce goals. To analyze compensation vs performance, this example shows the number of active employees by rank level or job role and salary by employee rank. Also, this dashboard is useful for analyzing the performance rating of each employee or department.

While the employee attrition dashboard is used for a summary of the number of employees that have left the company (attrition rates) and provides a comprehensive overview of employee turnover within the organization. It offers insights into key attrition metrics, such as attrition by department, tenure, and age etc. It enables HR professionals to identify patterns, potential areas of concern, and opportunities for improvement. This invaluable tool empowers data-driven decision-making to enhance employee retention strategies and optimize workforce management.
